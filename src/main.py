# Pandas is a comprehensive library in Python designed for data manipulation and analysis.
# While it builds upon the capabilities of NumPy, which focuses on numerical operations,
# Pandas offers extensive functions for handling tabular data, including importing datasets, cleaning data, and analyzing statistics.
# Its name “Pandas” may reflect its association with bear families or other fictional contexts,
# but it is rooted in its ability to organize and manipulate data efficiently.

# Key features of Pandas include:

# DataFrame Object: Similar to NumPy’s array, Pandas provides a DataFrame for tabular data storage.
# Handling Missing Data: It includes functions for managing missing values, such as filling them or marking them as null.
# Merging Datasets: Pandas allows merging datasets from various sources, which is essential for comprehensive analysis.
# Time Series Analysis: Specialized tools for handling time series data.
# Data Visualization: Integration with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations.
# Pandas is widely used in fields like finance, healthcare, and social sciences due to its versatility in managing diverse data structures
# and performing complex operations efficiently.
